# GMDM: Redux
Automatically exported from code.google.com/p/gmdm

This is a gamemode for Garry's Mod 10 that was created in 2008 by Garry Newman then expanded by a small team in 2008-2009 by myself and a few others in the Luahelp community. This mode will probably not work in the latest version of Garry's Mod.

## Features

- Deathmatch with TDM support.
- Ridiculous amount of gore.
- That's about it.
